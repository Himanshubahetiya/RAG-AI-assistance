He did C So this is not your mistake So accuracy 4% is not your fault This operator has done wrong So this was the second one On-showing means Tesla Now the factory is in China And again he has put the factory in America That I have to make everything local I have to give jobs to the local people etc So the explanation is also correct That one-showing is correct But the code is wrong So this is also wrong I have told him to fix this And again my apologies for this Here also your mistake is not your fault Third question is although it is your fault Third question is See What was the depreciation? That your car was worth 10 lakhs Now it is worth 6 lakhs So from your profit If you minus depreciation You get your true profit On which the company has to make its corporation tax So statement 1 which says depreciation helps to ascertain true profit or loss That is correct Statement 2 says that depreciation is a non-cash expense Because its money is going out That is also correct But does statement 2 explain statement 1? The answer is no Because if you understand What is depreciation and what is non-cash It doesn't make any difference We get to know the loss from that That is correct So the characteristic that it is a non-cash expense Even if it was a cash expense The answer was the same So both are correct But ST2 does not explain ST1 Although according to our interpretation It can be And I also agree with you It can be This is why it is made so forcefully So that you get experience That the examiners run in their mind So many times it happens Then it happens Anyway so that was the quiz Now our next part is inflation I have uploaded the handout If you are watching from desktop or laptop You can go to PCP 11 course Click on update button Right side sidebar opens You can download from there Although there is some problem Some technical bugs If you click on update Old post is showing empty And I have already complained about it They are watching it Hopefully it should get resolved Similarly if you are doing it from mobile Click on the mobile app My name is Kunal Patel Go to batch score 6 PCP 11 avatar Click on it And click on update button Right side sidebar opens Means page opens directly PDF is visible in it Click on top corner Download option comes But there is some problem here That the labels of old files Are not visible Although I was seeing the latest file And I have also complained about it And the technical team is looking into this Anyways if we want to read Let's read pillar 4 E Macroeconomic indicator Sub topic inflation Macroeconomic means The whole country is watching If there is such production Then GDP is there We have seen such import and export So what is inflation? On one side there is supply Suppose 10 kg of onion On the other side there is demand Now the supply and demand match And the price on it Suppose onion should be 15 rupees per kg Then we say general price level Prices are normal Sometimes it happens That supply increases more But demand is not that much Then shopkeeper has to make the goods cheaper Otherwise it will get rotten I have to sell it before it rots So it is possible that they sell it for 5 rupees So what is this? Upspeed is cheap but deflation is there If supply decreases If rainfall is not good There were some other problems In the supply chain But demand increases in front of it Then what happens? If onion is 15 rupees If it is 50 rupees per kg Then we say inflation So that is inflation Now you understand Suppose 100 rupees is the general price level That it should be normal If it is less than 90 rupees Then we will say deflation If it is 110 rupees Then it is inflation So now on this position RBI or government will try to reduce the inflation So what will they do? Make it 109 Make it 106 Make it 103 So the price that is brought down Towards the general level We call it deflation For that what can RBI do? We have already seen that In monetary policy If it becomes cheap Then that is also not good Because you remember According to Philip's law Unemployment will be affected So it has to be brought from here Because if 90 rupees becomes very cheap Then farmer will remove agricultural labourers Jobs will be lost So again RBI will try That it should be 100 So try to make it 90, 96, 99 So try to bring the price Towards the general level What is called deflation Now you see This chart is like this Suppose it is 10 kg Or 10 cm So what do we call this? General price level When do we get general price level? When we get general price level When the price level is When the price level is When the price level is When the price level is When do we get general price level? When supply and demand Equal to something That 5 kg onion Farmer produced And 5 kg onion is in front Which the customer wants to buy That is called general price level So when does general price level become? When the aggregate demand Matches the aggregate supply Now you ask the question What is aggregate demand? And what is aggregate supply? Suppose if aggregate supply Is 10 kg Then how does supply come? When economy is on full employment Means all such people Who want to do something They have got some work They are producing something We will ignore voluntary unemployment Means those fathers Who do not want to work On their own will We ignore them We ignore frictional unemployment Because we want to We ignore frictional unemployment Now remember Arnab Goswami Who left Times Now And then I am going For a job in Republic TV So he was unemployed For 3 months We call it frictional unemployment So you ignore such people And all those who want to work Suppose they have got work And then if 10 kg onion is born Then we will say That is the aggregate supply Of all the farms and producers At that time it will be That the aggregate demand Will be of 10 kg Because all those who wanted work Have got it And all are producing Those who got job And salary They are buying Now at that time Supply and demand match And suppose they should sell For 15 rupees Then we call it general price level And then there is a person Who is very interested in money He said all this In his book So he has to remember That it was said By John Maynard Keynes It's so hot If I speak for 10 minutes My throat dries So I was saying General price level When supply and demand Match then the price That is general price level Now for some reason It is possible Suppose supply is 100 kg But the demand in front Increases a little more 150 kg So suppose The chart is made In such a way That the supply Is 100 kg And if the demand increases Then you know According to that Someone give me I will give you more money Give me this onion for 15 rupees Another one Give me this onion for 16 rupees So this is pulling The price from one side So what will we call it Demand pool So when it happens That on one side Our aggregate supply is 100 kg But the demand in front Is more than that Because of 150 kg So this 50 kg extra Demand That will create A gap And it is called inflationary gap And because of that The inflation comes It is called Demand pool inflation How is the gap like this If this is the length Then the gap is like If the demand increases Then the demand will increase Because our aggregate demand Will increase So what will happen in aggregate demand So suppose The expenditure side Which we used to write Mostly the same thing will come Consumption, Investment, Government expenditure Export All this can come in it Because people do shopping That's why the demand is increasing With this we will prepare the reason That why there is a problem Of inflation By the way you know We have to remember it systematically Because sometimes Factors are asked in MCQ So you should be aware So when can be When there can be An inflationary gap And demand pool inflation When will the demand pool inflation Increase when the demand increases So this is the first reason That why the demand is increasing Second reason Increased propensity to consume People of old times They think That if there is a hotel Or restaurant Then we should not eat We should cook at home Now the new generation They go out to buy 2-3 pieces of meat So what is this Increased propensity to consume According to that The demand for onion, fast food And all things increased According to that The demand for edible oil increased So all this will be inflation Third is investment expenditure If Adani feels That I will buy new airports I will make it I will get profit So according to that The demand for steel, cement etc. will increase Fourth reason The government should spend As much as it can But in the fissure deficit The government spends more To make new highways, hospitals Or if there is an election Or a railway culture They give 200 units electricity Or mobile laptops So in all this The government is increasing Its shopping Which they cannot buy With their own money So what should they do They should take money in loan So whenever there is a fissure deficit There could be a problem of inflation Fifth reason Could be export Because if there is Agriculture demand Then the export of our goods Is it less for the local public So you remember In pillar 3 and 4a We saw how the government Banned the export of rice And put more limit So the demand is less Compared to the export And because In the name of aggregate demand CIG, X Are becoming Components of GDP So whenever the growth will increase Demand will increase Growth means GDP will increase That means demand will increase Public will have more money They will have more jobs Production will increase GDP will increase Salary will increase And then he is buying more things So always the GDP growth Is accompanied Along with that It brings inflation So GDP growth Brings inflation Same way success Brings arrogance So if success Also brings arrogance Then GDP is also bringing A little bit of inflation Suppose The price of onion Is 10 to 20 to 150 rupees So what will the workers do They will ask the factory owner To give more salary Because they are not able to buy onions And we will go on strike So that happens The businessmen will have problem So they will increase their salary Earlier it was 15000 Now it is 17000 But the businessman's 2000 extra Expenses will increase So the TV mobile will increase Its price by 2000 So the TV will become expensive So inflation will increase So the other sector workers Will say we wanted to watch IPL So increase our salary So inflation will increase So this is called inflationary spiral Inflation could lead to more inflation This is also called wage inflation spiral Because inflation increases So people ask for more salary And because of that Now the question is How can we fix this problem That we have 100 kg supply But 150 kg demand And I have told you the reason That the public is shopping a lot So we have to do something We have to shrink the demand And bring it to the original state We have to bring it to 100 kg So this can be done We should do something to reduce the demand Or the other thing can be We should do something to increase the supply How to increase the farming So that instead of 100 kg 150 kg of onion can be produced Something like this So that the supply increases Two things can be done First of all what can RBI do So RBI You remember We have already reached 1 or 2 DL money policy Means they can make their rap more expensive CRR more expensive What can the government do If they do less shopping Then the demand will come under control We have already reached 1 or 2 After seeing this You should be able to visualize That we have seen all this Okay but what can the government do RBI can do this To fight this expensive What can the government do Government should control their fees and deficit Then the government will come under control Then the CIGX Government expenditure will be reduced So the demand will be reduced So the government can try to control Its fees and deficit In other words What does it say Government should stop the fees and deficit Should not make new highway hospitals Should not give electricity Should not give laptop mobile Should reduce all this Then the demand will be reduced Government should stop the schemes and subsidies That increase money in the hands of people Without increasing production For example If the government is giving 6,000 rupees But the government is not buying Directly giving money to the farmer So that is creating more demand Without increasing supply You know if the public Buy gold Then the dollar becomes strong And because of that Imported inflation can be a problem Because the thing which was imported For 50 rupees Now if you have to import for 80 rupees Then it will increase So how can the government reduce The gold consumption For that we have already reached Inflation index bond Pillar 1C Sovereign gold bonds We have seen that in pillar 3 And pillar 1C Such things where you get Something like gold price Or some inflation proof return If there is a profit So the public should import less gold So the current account should be in control So what can the government do To increase the supply According to the essential commodity Stock limit Which we saw in pillar 4A By increasing the minimum export price By reducing the export of onions So that the local supply of onions FCI should start selling wheat rice Under its open market sale scheme So that the middle class Get a little cheaper Operation green star In which tomato, onion, potato And other fruits and vegetables Are stored And supply should be improved So that the wastage should be less Around the year 365 days You should get the supply From the price stabilization fund FCI should be given money In the loan With the help of which Egypt, Turkey imported onions And brought it to India And its price should be stable Because the supply of onions From Egypt and Turkey Will increase And the supply will increase So that the price should be stable To improve the production Whatever can be done Tax deduction, tax exemption Subsidy should be given This is also important So the government can do all this From its side Whenever it is asked about MCQ It should be fixed in the photo frame For example I told you that the government Should give a better MSP To the farmer Minimum support price Suppose earlier he used to give 1500 rupees On the pulse I mean on the dal So now suppose he gives 1600 So that the farmer feels And he says that I will not grow rice from now I will grow dal We have already read this matter In pillar 4A agriculture You can see that Now the question is For that we will give you more MSP So that you can get better You don't grow rice I mean whatever you are growing You can grow All the people of India You don't have to grow Some people grow dal And for that we will give you more MSP So here the matter will end That it helps to control inflation Then don't go above this Some people will say According to this The farmer used to get 15000 Now he will get 1700 So he will buy a new bungalow And if he gets a bungalow Then the demand for bungalow will increase So according to that Home prices will increase So inflation will not be solved Inflation is increasing So here you are cooking birbal khichdi You are trying to fix it When you are trying to get out of the photo frame The step B leads to B Step B leads to C That is how you cook birbal khichdi In UPSC MCQ If you run more than that You think UPSC examiners don't think like that Suppose inflation Means the rents have increased a lot Earlier 1 annual Which was of 5 rupees Suddenly it became of 100 rupees What can RBI do RBI makes loans expensive So that it can reduce public shopping But you understand If the loans become too expensive Then what will happen If there is too much inflation And then RBI increases the loan interest To make the loans expensive To combat that inflation Then what will happen If the loans will become expensive Will reduce the public shopping So all these Geophone are made BPL and video phone TV fridges RBI should not increase the loan interest rate so much that it will harm GDP Suppose if the loan interest rate is 7% and if it is increased to 10% then yes you can fight inflation But it will harm GDP If you say yes then reduce the loan But if you reduce the loan so much that it will result in increased demand vs increased supply Then it may lead to inflation Means what should be the loan interest rate? It should not be too high or too low The loan interest rate should not be too high or too low Now the optimal interest rate of a loan Suppose we say 7% What will you call it? Neutral rate of interest What does neutral rate of interest mean? It is a loan that neither harms GDP nor increases inflation It keeps inflation under control So that is the neutral rate of interest Till now we have seen the general price level And in that equilibrium where supply and demand matched But if the supply decreases for some reason and the demand increases then inflation comes We have completed the angle of this side Now we go to the other side, the left hand side Supply increased, earlier it was 10 kg, now it is 15 kg But the demand is still 10 kg Then what will happen? We will have to make the goods cheaper Otherwise if no one buys it, it will rot And due to this fear Due to this fear, the businessmen, traders, merchants, sellers They will make their goods cheaper So that is called deflation So deficiency in demand Or the demand decreases Even then a gap is created That is called deflationary gap It is like this Suppose this is a width of 100 kg Now for some reason, there is so much supply For some reason, the demand is only 80 kg So that means there is a gap So the gap created here 20 kg people are buying less What is that? That will create a deflationary situation So that is what I have written here When is the deflationary gap? When the aggregate supply is 100 kg But the aggregate demand in front decreases Only 80 kg So the gap created here 20 kg That is called deflationary gap And all this goods will become cheaper It will have to be made cheaper Because otherwise the seller will suffer losses Because then the onion and tomato will get bigger So now the question is When can such a deflationary gap occur? So guess We have understood the reason for the inflationary gap If you want to say the opposite of that Then the answer will be If for some reason the money supply decreases Then loans will become expensive If loans become expensive, then the public will do less shopping Then the consumption will decrease That is deflationary gap Now how can that happen? Remember that pillar 1 or 2 Whenever the RPA rate increases If the SLR and CRR are increased Then the loanable funds will decrease Then the loans will become expensive Then the shopping will be less The second thing is If there is an increased propensity to save What did we see next? That people of the old times Did not go to restaurants They used to cook at home Now people go out more So the demand has increased So the third thing is Remember all this Reduce the need And the public will do the same Because they never want to order from Jomato So if there is an increased propensity to save Then the gap will close Or sometimes it happens That the customer thinks I don't shop now I wait now Suppose you thought I want to buy a car And the chip of the microprocessor has become less Or the car of the factory is not working So what happens If you tell him He will say that I will deliver it after 4 months Then you think If you want to get it after 4 months Then I will wait a little more Diwali will come in 6 months Then you will reduce the price in the sale Then we will buy So if the consumer is delaying the purchase With the hope of further falling price Then what will happen? Then the consumer will think That the Supreme Court Or National Green Tribunal Who says that due to mining There is a lot of pollution You stop all this coal mining So if such a judgment comes in one state Then in another state I don't know what will happen Now they stop We don't have to go to mining Or highway hospital Our money can be lost So if there is a decrease in investment expenditure According to that The demand for steel, cement, etc. will decrease Then the gap will close If there is an increased Fiscal consolidation Or we say that for some reason If the government thinks That we save more money We reduce the fiscal expenditure We keep the fiscal deficit in control So if we keep it in too much control That from now on For the Royal Entry of the IAS officer If there is a reduction in exports Then that means The demand has reduced If there is a depression or recession What was that? We saw in the last pillar 4D Means there is a crisis There is a cycle in crisis That people have lost their jobs So they are reducing their shopping And because of that the demand is reducing So that can also result in aggregate demand So if you ask about the pay type How many of the following can Result in deflationary gap Then all of these things can result in deflationary gap Now here comes the deflationary spiral Suppose the demand for TV has reduced So because of that The price has to be reduced That 15 is not there Now there is a TV worth 10,000 rupees Then what will happen? Companies think We have to keep our profit same to same But here our product was 15 Even if there is no loss They will think that their profit is less So now I will remove some of my workers From the job I will give them layoff So there will be a problem of unemployment Now the one who lost his job He has no money So he will shop less So the demand will reduce So other companies will have to Reduce their products So this is also a problem This is called deflationary spiral The next issue is of Philip Kau Now we will talk about Philip Kau In 2 minutes But the next issue Which is associated with him is Nairu Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment That will take more time So what we do We take a 5 minute break So that we can continue both With a fresh mind So break for 5 minutes 3 more minutes 4% people are saying But can't see So press the ctrl or ctrl shift key On the keyboard Philip Kau We have already seen in pillar 1 or 2 But we will revisit again Because we have to understand this new concept So New Zealand economist He said that on the y-axis We write inflation That whatever the onion Is of 130 rupees Is of 140 rupees Is of 150 rupees And on the x-axis We write how many people are unemployed This one person is unemployed 2 people unemployed 3 people unemployed Now suppose Onion is selling for 150 rupees per kilogram In the graph you know the points We plot like this x, y So suppose the price of onion is 150 So I will write y as 150 So 2 people have a coat One person is standing with a bowl That means 1 person is unemployed So I will write 1 So 1, 150 So I have plotted this point here One thing Afterward Suppose the price of onion will be very cheap That is 20 rupees per kilogram So what will the farmer think That this is not getting a good price I will remove the laborers from the job I don't have money I will remove the farm laborers Because onions have become very cheap So some people are removed from the job So how many unemployed people are standing 2 people are standing with a bowl So I will write x is 2 And the onion has become cheap So 20 So y is 20 So you keep plotting different points Keep plotting So then You get a shape like this Like there is an eye Which is looking towards the center Towards the point of origin So what does this tell us If inflation increases Jobs will increase If the onion is 20 It is 150 So earlier 1 person had a job Now 2 people have a job Or we will say Earlier 2 people were unemployed Now only 1 person is unemployed Reverse is also true If the deflation becomes cheap Jobs will decrease If the onion is 150 It is 20 So jobs will decrease Earlier 2 people had a job Now only 1 person has a job Because companies To keep their profit margin same Remove people from the job However, friends This is true up to a certain level only What do you think If the onion is 5000 rupees per kilogram Then there will be no unemployment in India Everyone will get a job Because then there can be 2 things Either we will stop eating public onion And will not eat onion for 5000 rupees Or everyone will say That onion is 5000 rupees per kilogram Then we will not give IIT exam NEET exam IS exam We all have to go and do agriculture But then what will happen There will be overflow of onions It will be so much That it will harm the economy in a different way There is an associated concept Tulip mania We may have read it Or we will read it later Like the craziness in bitcoin In the past, tulip was there We will see what it is Now What does this flip cup tell us That there should be a little inflation Control a lot on inflation And the loss of profit is more than that Excessive inflation control is not beneficial Because if in year 1 The onion is of 150 rupees in the first year Government will say No, no, the election is coming It will have to be very strict And we will do everything Whatever is possible And we will control the price of onion To just 5 rupees per kilogram So what will happen in year 2 The farmer's side will smile I don't want to grow onions I will work some other time This is not profitable for me To sell the onion set 5 rupees per kilogram So what will happen If there is no onion in year 2 Then the shortage of onions Then it will increase again So you have to keep the inflation In certain level only Do not make it negative It should not be like this So you remember What is the target of RBI The inflation should not be 0 The target is to control it in 2-6% First you see A jobless man is sitting with a bowl So the demand for onion is 0 kg Because he does not have money Then why will he buy Suppose he got a job So he got a salary So he will go shopping So with job there is a demand For 5 kg of onions And what we have understood till now Whenever the demand for onion will increase Then it is expected that Its price will also increase So when he was an onion employee There was no demand Then the price of onion was 20 rupees He is not demanding money No one is buying onions in the world The farmer must be selling and earning So at that point The price of onion is 20 rupees But now because the demand has increased 5 kg So the price of onion will also increase That instead of 20, it will be 50 So here you understand What I am telling you As people get jobs Product demand increases If product demand increases Then inflation increases This is common sense But it will be more complex In 2-3 slides So I give you 30 seconds First print this photo in your mind After that let's move forward If there are more jobs There is more demand And then there is more inflation Ok So I make a table There are unemployed people And there is inflation Suppose Jobless people were 5% So let's assume inflation was 2% Then for some reason Some scheme of the government came Prime Minister, give employment scheme And jobs started getting So the unemployed people became less Suppose 4% Although the inflation will not decrease immediately Suppose it is still 2% Then the government and some Prime Minister Double-joke scheme Give jobs scheme Unemployment scheme And now only 3% people are unemployed Now slowly they got jobs And I told you ahead As soon as the demand of the job will increase Then the price will increase So now inflation is skyrocketing a little That it becomes 5% So this is also a matter of common sense I have seen it in the previous slide As soon as the unemployment will decrease Then inflation will increase Ok Now I start plotting it in the graph Let's write inflation on the y-axis Let's write unemployment on the x-axis And you know the point x, y So what is this one Unemployment is 5 Means x And inflation is 2 Means y Then what was the other one 4, 2 So I wrote it here 4, 2 Then what happened Many people got jobs Unemployment decreased Then they had to give up shopping So the demand increased So the price increased So that point was 3, 5 So I write it here 3, 5 This is x, y What we have studied is the same Now the real concept will start Suppose there is an aeroplane And a runway Let's say 100 meters from the takeoff So it is standing on the ground here And here Then you know that if it takes off It will go straight up So similarly what is happening here It is standing on the ground here And here Then it is going straight up So the concept associated with it is Nairo Nairo means It is the barrier of unemployment If unemployment is less than that Then the price will increase Understand Earlier there was unemployment How much? 5 Then it became 4 Till then there was no change in inflation It was 2, 2 But if we reduced the unemployment More than this Then the plane of inflation Took off And the plane of inflation Went up in the air Frequently reconnecting I was here But I reconnected myself After 3-4 times Now 9.48 is shown on my clock I will do the poll once When it is 9.50 After that we will resume it again Till then the rest of the people Will also sync the devices Till then I will wait I am here Wait 10 more seconds Then we will again do a poll Alright friends before moving ahead Tell me the voting line Can you see me? Can you see me? Can you see me? Can you see me? So you can vote for me Harsh, Vishal, Shivendra, Rekha, Ruchi Prince, Pollak, Vishal, Madhuri, Sachin Gaurav, Ananya And others, Dhan Saridhar We move forward For the video may be For the video may be For the video may be For the video may be For the video may be Beware the same You are pressing the Ctrl\ud2b8\ub97c Some WhatsApp users are asking You can ask questions in the chat Then I will do the ad with that Let's refresh it again Unemployed person was buying 0 onions He got a job and he is buying 5 kg onions Because of that, onion demand is high in the market So, he is selling 20 rupee onions in 50 rupee As jobs will be created, inflation problem can arise We have made a table Unemployment is decreasing from 5 to 4 to 3 So, inflation is increasing from 2 to 5 Why inflation is not increasing from 2 to 3? I want to give you a concept Assume that plane has not taken off yet Now, we plotted these numbers on a graph 5 to 4 to 2 Now, we have to understand a concept And that was NIRU Non Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment He is talking about the last one Unemployment He is saying that Suppose, when unemployment was 5, inflation was 2 When unemployment was 4, inflation was 2 But when unemployment was 3, inflation was 5 So, inflation plane has taken off This means that if unemployment falls below this level If unemployment is less than this Then inflation will rise So, that is the level of unemployment Suppose, 4 to 5% But suppose, till this level Unemployment is there, then inflation is stable We are not asking the rate of inflation We are asking the rate of unemployment If it is less than this, then inflation can rise So, NIRU level of unemployment is somewhere here Between 4% to 5% So, that is NIRU I am giving you 40 seconds Keep this graph in mind Okay Now, the question is What is the real life OPO of this graph We have seen NIRU level of unemployment Suppose, 4 to 5% unemployment is there, then inflation is stable Of course, we want that everyone should get jobs So, government will think that we should do some other scheme So that unemployment will be 3% But when they will pull the rope, then RBI will face a problem Because we have seen that as soon as unemployment will be less Then inflation will increase And we have seen that RBI's target is to keep inflation in 2% Otherwise, inflation will increase So, as soon as government will try to reduce unemployment Then RBI will face a problem In controlling inflation RBI will not say that let some people get unemployed RBI will keep an eye on the data If the election is coming soon Then government will increase the scheme So, I will get prepared in advance I will keep an eye on this number Suppose, it is 4.5, now it is 4.3, then 4.1, then 3.9 So, I will keep an eye on it So that inflation is in control And RBI will think about the advance That is the utility of this Nairu graph Suppose, the Nairu level was here Unemployment should be 4-5% So, government will launch the scheme to reduce unemployment So, RBI will keep an eye on this So that RBI can get ready in advance to combat inflation Reserve Bank will keep an eye on Nairu So that the pre-agreement of Megha-E-Neel Charan can be made Again, I am giving you 40 seconds Finish this now Then straight to the quiz And then straight to the graph I am not able to understand So, I will write it down and make a graph Then it will make sense If you start saying unemployment instead of unemployment Then it will be easier to understand But deliberately I am using the word unemployment Because suppose, in Nairu What is U? It is unemployment In that, there is I and I is inflation But in this graph, what is Nairu showing us? It is unemployment Therefore, I keep using the word unemployment And remember the full form It is the number of people who are unemployed And remember the full form of Nairu We just saw Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment It is showing unemployment Remember When the class is over, make a graph of it And finish it So far, we have seen how to control inflation We should not control it too much Otherwise, it can be difficult according to the Philip's Law Now let's move to deflation Many things have become cheap We have to try to increase prices sometimes So how to combat deflation? Things are becoming cheap If the price of onion is Rs.5, farmers are worried People are fired So what should the government do? Increase demand by doing something Decrease supply by doing something You will say, no it is not okay Because if I say that there is demand of 80 kg onion in the market And the farmer is sitting with 100 kg onion So we should tell the farmers to stop Growing onions So you are saying that farmers should reduce GDP You should not grow onions And reduce the GDP We should do something to decrease the supply But the government or RBI will not say that you should not grow Because it will be a problem in GDP So they should try to increase the demand So to fight the deflation If the price of onion is Rs.5 instead of Rs.10 We have to fight the deflation Procise the people to buy Encourage the people to do more shopping For that, forgive the tax GST can be reduced Give some subsidy Suppose you buy an electric vehicle The government will forgive you the amount of money you get on loan If you buy a car, they will forgive you the amount of money you get on loan They can come up with something Second thing is to increase the government's budget Increase the expenditure on public projects So that people will get jobs in the steel and cement industry So that they can do shopping So that the onion which is Rs.5 can become Rs.10 So that will also help We should not make inflation zero We should keep it in the range of 2-6% If it is zero, then increase it If it is 7, then reduce it RBI has been given the same target So what we have seen We should not make inflation too low If it is not zero, then we should bring it to 2 This is called reflation Also, we should not make inflation too high We have seen that So, we should try to bring the inflation to 2% What should RBI do for this? Make the loan cheaper in monetary policy Start giving the stimulus on their side That we have made it cheaper on different things We should try to do this We call it reflation So we learned about the inflation and deflation We have seen all this We have to understand the different types of inflation Let's read a few and then break We have seen demand-pull inflation That the public gets a lot of money And because of that, they do shopping For example, Pay commission Last time we saw that according to 7th pay commission If the IAS officer gets Rs.1 lakh Then if he gets more money, he will do more shopping If the supply does not match, then demand-pull inflation can happen Similarly, if PM is giving Rs.6000 Rahul Gandhi says that if he gets power, he will bring a justice scheme Where everyone will get Rs.72000 Or Rs.1 lakh, so that the market does not have that much product So if people get money in the name of universal basic income Everyone gets Rs.1 lakh, it can create a problem That is demand-pull inflation Monetary inflation, if Deh Dhanathan notes are printed Then RBI is printing more money but without taking care of the supply in the market The concept of monetizing of the deficit We had to do that with the pillar 2D FRBM Act That was in TTI and Versailles And then in Germany, Deh Dhanathan notes were printed But the supply of goods and services was not there in the market So we understood hyperinflation Cost-push inflation If crude oil becomes expensive, then the transport taxis will increase their price So according to that, if you see the cost-push inflation Then it is because the raw material is expensive Similarly, the labor union If they say increase our salary, then the wages will increase So the businessmen will have to increase their product Because the labor will increase, so it is because of that So it is because of that Natural disaster, cyclone tsunami Because of that, potato, chili, tomato production fell So the companies that make wafer chips will increase their product Because of that, the cost-push has increased Then profit-push inflation For example, OPEC cartels, if they want to earn more profit Then they forcefully increase the price of the oil by controlling the supply Which we have studied in pillar 3 If there is only one company in that economy, then it is Oligopoly It is also a cartel type, we will understand it in microeconomics You can see the recorded class of it, because there were only 2 questions in the last 12 years So if you have time, then watch it, if not, then watch the rest So when they control their supply or production on purpose Limit it so that things become expensive Because they want to earn profit, so profit-push inflation I told you that if inflation increases, then workers go on strike To increase their salary, that is, wages So if their salary increases, then the price of the TV fridge also increases So inflation comes, so this cycle has become Inflationary spiral, it is also called built-in inflation Because you understand that as soon as the wage increases, the inflation increases So demand to increase the wage will increase, so it is built-in So built-in inflation, if the price increases, then the wage increases This is also called price-wage inflationary spiral"
