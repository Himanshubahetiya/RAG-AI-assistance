Will it sell 500 kg and how much will it sell to Zindal or Bhushan Steel?  Will it sell 200 kg?

are not able to see so press the Ctrl R or Ctrl Shift Use Chrome browser, disable addon, login in Community mode, hopefully it should work Check from mobile, make sure internet is good, then it should work Write any doubt in class, after class is over Ask from Google form, whose link is in the chat box, first link And then I will make a PDF file and upload it I have uploaded the answer to the question which came till last week 30th We have studied Pillar 4, Inflation Inflation test had 35 questions, 2 marks and 70 marks Those who scored more than 55, I have told them all Because it was relatively easy and many concepts were there Those who scored more than 55, I have told them all Surya, Purvi, Ayad, Rahul, Sonam, Teju, Kamalika, Ashutosh, Ashutosh, Nilofar, Ansh, Sanjay, Mani, Balwant, Meenasu, Anmol, Anurag, Simran Deep and others Now after this what we are going to study Pillar 1 is over, Money Banking, Finance, Insurance, Pillar 2 is over, Budget, Taxation, Pillar 3, International Trade is over, Pillar 4, Sectors of Economy, GDP, Unemployment, Inflation is over Now only 2 things are left, Infrastructure and Human Resource Development What is the difference between these 2 pillars Mostly this is the government scheme, this is the portal, this is the ministry, this is the department, this is how it works In the name of return on investment, you can ask 1 or 2 schemes But if I will underline 1 or 2 schemes, it is not that the UPSC will ask more questions It will ask as much as it wants So I have given you the handout, 50 pages, all the handouts will be made I will give you an outline that this was the main scheme, you can see the rest of the small things Because I don't want to keep you hanging in this economy for 6 months You have to finish the rest, history, geography, quality etc So normally the speed at which the car ran in Pillar 1, 2, 4, it will run faster than that I am getting a shock, so I would like to tell them to start from the beginning If you have taken the new admission, you will feel the same, you will feel dizzy So you come from the beginning, then you will know what is the rhythm of studying So see, today is 2nd Now suppose next 2 next Sunday means 12th In week 2, I will finish this, both Pillar 5 and 6 The car will run very fast And the reason for finishing this, because you remember the prelim exams were going to be in May So according to that, I said that if you finish here, you will get 2 weeks Now I am not postponing this, otherwise those whose subscription is ending, they will get 9th And anyway you get 1 month of revision So that is economy Now here, those who have taken the new admission, the target of 2025, I would like to tell them I am not stopping you, you can sit here or there Next course will come in June or July Which is PCP 12, means after 12th Corona Now it is running from February, it is almost 80% over So if you are new and targeting 2025 and you have recently joined So start the hot cooking again Then you can come, sometime in June or July Till then, what to do, in other academies, finish the history, geography, quality classes of other teachers Do that, then come back Now you will see the record, you can see But in that, you will start fast forwarding Then if he does not enjoy, then skip it So you will not be able to absorb, when it is hot, means the live class is going on That is better, because in live class you cannot fast forward Anyways, so let's start the infrastructure There will be three handouts, Pillar 5A, Bijli Pani, Pillar 5B, Sada Gaya Transportation Pillar 5C, Rural Urban Communication and Public Private Partnership So I have uploaded the first handout, you can download the first handout Where, from PCLab.com, means www.kb.com.in Scroll a little bit in that, there is a course called PCB 11 Open the course page, there is an update button, click on it, from the right hand side, you will get the material from there From the mobile app, you can see, my name is Sachin Kumar Patel Go a little down in the batches course, there is PCB 11 In that, you click on the update button, a new page opens Open the pdf in that, in the top right corner, there are three dots, click on it, download option comes You can also ask me questions in Google form, I will put the answer in the description So you will get the PDF from there So now, Pillar 1, 2, 3, 4 done Now let's move to Pillar 5 In Pillar 5, the infrastructure is like this, everything runs smoothly, two questions, two questions Sometimes, there are more questions, but in most of the time, there are random bombs, which we have not heard Anyways, around one or two questions Sometimes, it is easy, sometimes, it is very tough If you say, then I will skip it I will not stop you, you can skip it, I have to read it, if I feel so Otherwise, I will say, leave it, then what is the point of saying, leave all this Besides, I feel that, in comparison to medieval history, its cost benefit is still good Anyways, what will we understand here We will understand the scheme portal, departmental ministry, etc. We will not understand the railway budget, because there is no such thing as railway budget And if it merges with the general budget, then we will see what will be the new general Technical consultation paper, apply, and this is the technical thing of the fire team, which has no reward to ask, we will not read it We will not read the mains, because it has a separate course, that will come after the prelim On academies like Netflix, you can see there And if your subscription is over before that, then you can see the old course of the mains Then let's start infrastructure What is infrastructure, you understand all this Set of basic facilities From which an economy functions, grows For example, energy, education, road, transport, railway, all these are called infrastructure, basic facilities It has some characteristics that you have to remember for MCQ Sometimes it can be monopoly, like railway Only government rail can run, private rail can't run This is true, but nowadays the government says that private rail can run We will see that tomorrow But sometimes it can be a monopoly, it can be an authority Some costs are high Suppose you have made an airport, but no tourists come there Then you can take this road and take it to some other city Because the cost of its transport will be high So once it fails, it is difficult to withdraw the money of investment If the airport is closed down, then there is no value of asphalt So some costs are very high, money is lost, cannot withdraw Third, the output is often non-tradable in nature Suppose it is in Mumbai, it is not possible to withdraw money It is not like a box of carrots Sometimes it cannot be touched, like electricity, it will be a shock The output is non-rival in nature Suppose 100 iPhones are produced If I buy one, how much will be left for you? 99 But can you say that I am walking on the street, so this road is less for you No, of course, up to a limit If 1000 people are standing on the same road, then it will not be left for you But otherwise it does not reduce the availability If two people are standing under the street light, then the street light will not be less Of course, up to a sensible limit If 25 people are standing, then the street light will not be less But if you are standing on the road, then the street light will not be less If you are standing on the road, then the street light will not be less Of course, up to a sensible limit But ignoring such exceptions, consumption is often non-rival in nature If one person uses it, then the availability for the other is not less It is difficult to stop the free code here Suppose there is a person who does not pay GST, income tax Even then he will stand under the street light, he will get it, he can also walk on the road So price exclusion is often difficult compared to iPhone Because you can't buy an iPhone if you don't have money But here it is not like that, even if you don't have money, you can use it Usually it creates positive externality Suppose an airport is built, then tourists are happy, airline companies are happy But along with that, the taxi drivers, hotel owners are also happy Because they also get some work So what is all this? If the third party gets some positive benefit, then it is positive externality Now we can classify such infrastructures in different ways First, you understand Bipas, electricity, water, road Energy, water, sanitation, transportation There are also subtypes in that, what are they? Complete these three Then there is social infrastructure Like school, hospital, stadium, panchayat, house And there are different schemes for that too, which we will understand later Some are commercial infrastructure Where we have seen in pillar 3, food parks, textile parks, PM Mitra, etc. We have seen that in pillar 3, pillar 4 Communication, 5G, etc. infrastructure can also be seen in pillar 4, CRD Now if the government says that from now on If any government is not able to do anything Then it will be a problem If someone runs a PUBG server, then it is an infrastructure Suppose the government announces this What happens if they get money from the labor or the creators? It will be very beneficial Because the government says that running a PUBG server is an infrastructure So it is an infrastructure means what? It will get benefits in different schemes You go to the government and say that give me a land for 1 rupee for 99 years Because I want to put a big server here, you said infrastructure, government, don't do it You will get environment clearance soon, the FDI file will be approved soon RBI can give you some relief in external commercial borrowing In a time, if you have taken a loan And it is a non-performing asset Then also the government will give it restructuring I saw this in pillar 1b Lowering the interest, increasing the loan tenure Paying it slowly, not in 25 years, but in 50 years, all this can happen SEBI can also help, like the mutual funds of Rites and Invites They can say that minimum amount of money you have to put in this infrastructure project Insurance and pension regulators can also say That the minimum amount of money you get in premium You have to put that in infrastructure And you say that PUBG server is an infrastructure, so money can come in share bond World bank can also pass you a loan soon So these are the benefits of getting infrastructure label And in the same way, the government has given some new things Infrastructure label in the budget of 2022 Data center in which the server runs, energy storage system means battery Electric vehicle charging infrastructure and grid scale battery system Means all this solar energy is not 24x7 You have to store it in battery, like the big battery In the same way, all the companies have to be given infrastructure status Then they will give tax, subsidy, loan, and will give pardon This is what the government said After this, there are many ministries Ministry of heavy industry, steel, chemical, petroleum, natural gas, mines, coal etc Now some people, this handout is of 50 pages And why 50 pages, all this is given by the ministry Now some people will say that I don't want to read this I will leave it How do they know that leave them, leave the world Leave the world also Now UPSC asks information like yearbook Now the one who is sitting from the beginning will be able to appreciate Remember pillar 1, FSDC, macroeconomic stability, finance minister, chairman Bank board bureau, they asked two questions Remember that, read pillar 1, then you will be able to appreciate Budget is made by department of economic affairs, this also asked by UPSC in PYQ Then who decides MSP, was it agriculture or cabinet committee on economic affairs Then asked in pillar 3, is there a T-ball office in Dubai or not Remember in pillar 4, asked about the corruption, the chairman of that, means does he report directly or not In pillar 5, many questions have come Petroleum, natural gas regulation board, coal controller organization, sanitation coalition National infrastructure investment fund, district mineral foundation, etc So there are, that's why I gave you Some people say I don't remember I didn't show you the pistol, you don't remember, no problem Then remember geography, history, etc No need to sleep, no need to feel stress and suicide Now I have felt it, so I have to give In the exam other than IAS, they ask a lot So it is useful So many such ministries, I was telling you Many such ministries come here Heavy industry, steel, chemical, petroleum, natural gas, coal mine, etc I gave that handout, you read and finish it, I am not going there I have already told you in pillar 2, I will repeat it Ministry department is made by government through gazette notification They are under the subordinate office, but they have operational freedom If it is National health authority, Prime minister, general, 5 lakhs health insurance So if it is the chairman of the national health authority, I have to keep a new one And I will bring it from Ahmedabad and give him 50 lakhs salary Then he can give, minister will not interfere They have some operational freedom, like any subordinate office Statutory body, you understand, which is made by the law And they also get some freedom in operation because they don't have to go directly to the minister So this RBI, CBI, LIC, etc, is very easy CPSC means government company like NGC, etc Autonomous body means Sangeet Lalit Kala Natak Academy, Film Television Institute This autonomous body is usually Society Registration Act Multistate Cooperative Society, it is made in these, there is a governing council in these They don't have any purpose of making profit So these are all different types of organizations And after that, there are many ministries, all the organizations, there is a list of them Remember, at least once you have to see These 5-6 ministries, this is your homework, all this is given in the handout And you have to finish it, so that is done Now let's move ahead In this, some ministries, like steel ministry So they have launched an initiative called Purvodaya Initiative, remember this line Purvodaya means Eastern, so in the Eastern part, all the iron and mines Mines of iron and iron, connect it to the railway Connect it to the steel plant, they will do all this, that is Purvodaya Initiative Remember this line Many years ago, the economic survey used some terms And the mock test people, if they don't update their question bank They ask old questions, so I have to tell a few things Otherwise, people in Google form keep asking me, you didn't read it So, Dutch disease, I find it is not Very important, because it is an old thing, but anyway Let's go in a minute, natural gas was found in the Netherlands So many foreigners came there to invest So they will bring a lot of dollars, so the dollar will become weak Because whatever thing's supply increases, it becomes weak, it becomes cheap We have understood that pillar 3 And as soon as the local currency becomes strong, you should know It is bad for the exporter, because the foreigners Will start buying from some other country, so all the farmers there Agricultural dairy industry is ruined, and then all these farmers Now we also go to the gas companies and work there So the agricultural production will be reduced, the farmer shift to the oil and gas industry So the food shortage will be there, hyperinflation Will be very expensive, food riots, food will start looting So all this is called Dutch disease, what lesson do we get from this Sometimes the natural resources you have It becomes a curse for you, it becomes a curse, your natural resources become your curse Parallelly There is another such concept, resource curse, like Venezuela Venezuela has a very big oil reserve, but look there Looting and riot for food is the most expensive So what is this paradox of plenty Such a dilemma that they have a lot of oil, but they are going to eat it Why will this happen, because all the politicians and mafias are there to loot the country And no one will pay attention to the rest of the things, so it is also a curse for them This is also the case in India, this 36 Garh, Jharkhand, Odisha They have a lot of mineral wealth, but because of this Mafia and politicians keep looting, no one cares about anyone So the government structure is poor, poverty is also very high there So what is all this, resource curse, and I did not say this, this is what the economic survey said So these are the terms we understood what you want to say Now let's come to mining What we understand from infrastructure Electricity, water, road, so what do you need to make electricity So first we will understand about mining Then we will understand about coal, what are its different policies, what are the schemes We will understand that, this is our beginning, now it will go We will take a little break Who regulates the mines and minerals in India As it is given in the union list I mean, the central government is regulating, but they have a lot of work And this is more than 95 minerals, where did we see So they classified it Sand, mica, granite, agar, chalk, gypsum, what is all this Non-metallic, except for metals, non-energy There is no mention of electricity, coal, petroleum So all this is minor, the minerals are there So the job of the state is to take care of the minor minerals Whatever is to be auctioned, whatever is to be regulated, you see And the rest, which is not in the minor list For example, atomic minerals and metallic minerals Like aluminum from bauxite, iron, then energy minerals Like coal, petroleum, natural gas, all these will be called major minerals And this will be regulated by the union So minor minerals regulated by state Major minerals regulated by union They have internally divided it Now the government will say that an iron ore mine Which is in Jharkhand, Odisha, let's auction it You will get the right to mine for 50 years And whatever company needs, agreement or license, put it So Ratan Tata said, my Tata Steel company, give me the whole area for 50 years And I will give you 10% of what I earn Give me the name of Jindal Street, I will share 20% And give me the name of Steel Authority of India, I will give 30% So the person who will give the amount will get it So Steel Authority of India will get this contract So that is how mining auctions work Now to regulate it, national mineral policy was made In this mineral policy, there are talks of minerals other than coal and fuel For example, this iron ore mining Now suppose a company got this license, Tata Steel Then it will think that it was given for 50 years And now in 30 years, it has to be given, so it can sell it to someone else Or both the companies say, let's merge it So earlier all the rules were strict, so the government said, no, let's make it easy Then there is a law to regulate this whole thing Mines and Mineral Development and Regulation Act It was originally in 1957, but it was improved in 2015 So this mining license, technically we call it mining lease Or concession, concession means not discount, concession means right here You got the right to mine this area for 50 years So how will you get it? Will you get it in charity? Will you get it if you buy an electoral bond? No You will get it through auctioning, no discretionary allotment Earlier, the government used to get it Jindal Steel is giving me more election funds, so I will give it to him Now this will not work, whatever has to be done will be done through auctioning Some government companies, like Steel Authority of India, that is a government company So many times the government gives it directly, that you do it yourself You have to do auctioning, the company that offers more will get the mining lease In this Mines and Mineral Development and Regulation Act They said that they will make two institutions One is Exploration Trust and the other is District Mineral Foundation And whoever has got this Jindal Steel, Tata Steel mining lease Suppose they are earning 100 crores So give this exploration trust and this district mineral foundation Make some rules like this So two institutions under the law One is Exploration Trust, so Jindal Steel, Tata Steel will have to pay some money It is written in the law, what will the exploration do, what is the scientist So they will find out what is chemical, I did research and I think something will happen So they will identify new areas where mineral resources can be The other institution made by the government is District Mineral Foundation DMF, so Jindal Steel, Tata Steel, wherever they are mining In Jharkhand, in which district they are doing, so they will have to pay some money Suppose 3 crores, so what will happen This district mineral foundation will work for the people there Made a school, playground, did a drinking water project So that is district mineral foundation Then what did the government say See Tata Steel has given 3 crores to the district mineral foundation So then They have the freedom to do whatever they want But many times what happens is that no one will use money in such places So they will keep studying like this So the government thought that we will take some initiative And we will use all the money in our schemes In the district water supply, health care, sanitation, education, skill project We will use all the money in that And this scheme will be called as Pradhan Mantri Khanichetra Kalyan Yojana So what are you asking for 2015 I made a video on CDS yesterday night, I asked for a 2014 scheme Sukumya Bharat, now that is such a low profile scheme, it doesn't make sense I am asking, you should know Now you must be thinking how did he dream of asking for a 2014 scheme I don't have that dream, India yearbook which is published every year So I asked the professor, ok tell me, something came out of it So whatever I gave, it is 50 pages, it is still a handout So I didn't dream of anything and wrote it there The yearbook I gave, the different ministry departments, the different schemes So yes you have to prepare this Now after this came Corona Corona got a lot of trouble, so the government In the Mines and Minerals Development Regulation Act, improved some of the reforms Let's understand that too Normally I told you that you get a 50 year lease But as soon as you get it, you should start mining there If you don't start mining within 2 years Then the government will cancel your license and give it to some other company So earlier there was a 2 year limit But then Tata complained that due to Corona lockdown, all my workers went back to their country So where should I mine? So the professor said, no problem, let's give you 1 year more If you don't start mining within 3 years, your license won't be cancelled Then I told you that the state has to auction the sand and other minerals But sometimes they don't do it Maybe there everything is illegal, mafia is doing it And if they auction it, Tata will complain Why is this mafia doing it? Don't auction, let everyone do it So the government won't be able to do it If the state government is not doing the auction of these minerals, then the union government will do it So we saw some basic things about mining After that comes coal In coal, you have to prepare some geography and science You can see the geography and science in the handout In coal After this, we take a break after 10 minutes Because we understood it in the flow Now remember, what happened during Nehru and Indira Gandhi's time Nationalization The private companies like Rajarajwada, British, are ruling And they are not doing good for the poor, profiteering So the government took over all the coal mining companies Government ownership So the law was made, coal mining nationalization act And it became a company called coal India So coal India is a public sector company So from now on, If anyone wants to do coal mining, it will be a monopoly But Tata said I want to make Tata Steel And you know that for steel, iron ore has to be melted So I want coal for my own steel, cement, aluminum factory And you are saying that you can't buy it from coal India Let me do my own coal mining So in the 90s, LPG reforms were being taken Prime Minister Narsimha Rao said You are a private sector company You want to do coal mining, we will allow But for captive use only Don't sell it to anyone else So now only the government will get the buffalo And no one else can do it So you can do it but you can't sell it to anyone So that is captive mining What is captive mining? This company can use coal for its own steel, cement, fertilizer And can't sell it to anyone else All these reforms were done during LPG reforms So Tata Steel, Zindabad Steel got license allocation Let's move ahead to 2013-14 So it was accused that in the time of Congress-UPI Ministers gave license to their relatives And all those were allotted in a wrong way So Supreme Court cancelled all those And all the controversies were going on After this controversy, Swabhai's government had to take some reforms So in 2015, the government brought a new law Coal Mines Special Provision Act In this, it was said that only captive use You want to use coal in your own steel, cement, industry You can't sell it to others Now the government said, don't do it We will allow for commercial purpose So you can use coal for yourself And after mining, you can sell it to others So now coal mining sector is open for commercial mining If asked what it wants to say, it will say You can't sell this to others After this, the situation got improved So now, if you want to apply for coal mining auctioning They say, you should have experience You should apply only if you have iron, steel, power Then the government gave reforms in 2020 Now any Indian company, even if they don't have experience They can apply for mining, they can also participate in the auctioning So prior experience is required Earlier it was necessary, now it's not Then license, earlier the types of license were different Like 2 wheeler, 4 wheeler, likewise survey license is different What is prospecting or survey? You have to check whether there is coal or not You have to take a license, it's called prospecting or survey license Then you know, there are significant coal reserves Then you have to apply for mining license Now there is no need of 2 wheeler, 4 wheeler There is only one composite license You can do both, survey first and then mining Many reforms were taken Earlier there was no permission for commercial mining Earlier only captive mining was allowed Now captive mining is not banned If Tata had taken 50 years license and it's not over It's not illegal Anyway, so that was the Mines and Mineral Development Regulation Act Now in 2023, some other reforms were taken We will read that later, it's better to finish mining at once It's not rocket science but the hindu made it But I have 3-4 years in this Let me tell you Beryllium, Lithium, Niobium, Titanium Tantalum, Zirconium Earlier government said that these are all atomic minerals So private companies like Adani Amman can't do mining Only government companies can do mining Now what will happen if these reforms are taken in 2023? That they will delete all of them So Adani Amman also can't do mining Suppose, Adani Amman is mining Beryllium, Zirconium and selling it to someone for 100 Rupees So government says that the mineral you sold for 100 Rupees We need royalty on that, X percentage So how much do you want? Earlier Lithium was 12% and now it's 3% So earlier Adani Amman had to give 12 Rupees to government So how much he had? 88 Now government has 3 Rupees So he will enjoy it And foreigners who want to invest in this sector will be happy Because they will think that their profitability will increase So we will also invest and get good dividend shareholding Similarly, the other minerals like Scandium, Yttrium, Cerium Adani Amman has given 12% royalty So royalty rates for the critical minerals have been reduced So we understood that the development regulation of mines and minerals is in 2023 Private sector entry in atomic minerals is allowed Royalty rates for critical minerals have been decreased And thirdly, they get licenses for more than a month How are mining licenses different? First is reconnaissance You check the area for anything Second is prospecting, then you go and do chemical test Then mining license Then government said that if you want to do both Then you get composite license Which is prospecting cum mining license Then a new category was started Exploration license Which is given for gold, silver, lithium Exploration license is between reconnaissance and prospecting Now we don't understand what is it technically If there are so many licenses, then who will give it? Union or state? So government made a list of 29 important minerals like gold, lithium, cobalt, lead And then it said that exploration license will be given by state And mining license will be given by union And if you want composite license, then union will also give I said, why do you have to do all this? I totally agree with you, but we have to pass the exam So I said, why is it like this? I don't know why it is like this Because the newspaper didn't write it, so I didn't go for RTI Second, if you have taken reconnaissance license Then you fly a drone and find out if there is any mineral Then reconnaissance is allowed Then you go to the surface and do some patrolling Then the surface one is also allowed Now you can do reconnaissance in sub-surface Permission was also given So what has been done in the Mines and Mineral Development Regulation Act of 2023 Improvements have been made, changes have been made Private sector entry in atomic mineral is correct Royalty rates for critical minerals have been reduced is correct New type of licenses have been allowed is correct Like Bombay High So an oil platform has been made in the sea, from there they will do mining and then oil tanker will come Its law is different and the government has made some changes in it So the thing is like this, offshore area mineral Development Regulation Act and it was amended in 2023 Earlier, mining in the sea was allowed For example, Yajani got the license Earlier it was that he will get a license for 30 years Then he can renew for 20 years, means he will get 50 years But now when you keep two steps like this Then after 30 years, he will go to renew at 31 years So definitely the ministerial IAS will trouble him to give bribe Because you are stuck, you have made everything, whatever mining infrastructure Now the government said that not in two times, but in one time you will get a license for 50 years Because if you give a loan, then it will end in one time Then again after 30 years, he will trouble and ask for a bribe So ease of doing business has been done Direct 50 years license will be given First, whatever mining is to be done in the offshore area So the government did administrative allocation by its own will To Adani, ONGC, whatever the government has given, it will give Now there is no such administrative allocation Because administrative allocation means that he will ask for a bribe and give Now it will be from auctioning, so the scope of bribe will be reduced So offshore mining license will be given based on auctioning Third, if you want to do mining of such atomic minerals like uranium, monazite, tholium in such offshore areas Then the government said that otherwise we cannot do mining Because only the government company can do the mining of atomic minerals in the offshore areas Only the government company can do mining of atomic minerals in the offshore areas We saw that a district mineral foundation was made That whoever will do mining of Tata Steel, Zindabad Steel, they will give money to the district mineral foundation And from there they will do all the good work So if mining is happening in the offshore area, then such an organization is made there also So the government said that let's make an organization Offshore area mineral trust, this is a statutory body And whoever got the license that you can do offshore mining, you can do mining in the ocean So they took some money, 3 crore rupees To give this statutory body, whose name is offshore area mineral trust And what work will it do? They said that it will do research, environment conservation, disaster management It will do all these things, so that is offshore area mineral trust So we understood a lot about coal and other minerals Let's take a small break, then we will continue our studies Till then you try PYQ Coal India is a santari company, they asked about it I have not taught you this, you said that you don't know, so skip it But keep your mind occupied for the next 5 minutes Then we will meet again, break for 5 minutes PYQ 3 more minutes Break for 5 minutes Break for 5 minutes But according to their official website, we are the single largest coal producing company So third is correct, first is correct, so the answer is B, 1 and 3 only So what lesson do we get from here? Accuracy, earlier we used to do it and it was gone before corona Nowadays accuracy is very important If you keep doing it blindly, sometimes it goes wrong And cut off is because why is there cut off 75 in 200? It can be more than that 80, but all these things were done by the coaching and the mock test That you should have done 90 And then they put all the statistical things in it If it can be done by sitting at home, then why not everyone become 2 And if it is like that, then why not all the players make 100 runs in every match If it is done by statistics Because in real life it doesn't work like that If you don't know, then you shouldn't do it blindly The mistakes that are made in IIT CAT exam, they are made because they make questions in fixed parameters It is not happening here We come back, we were studying mining We saw the new improvement of mining, now let's talk about selling of the coal We saw that Tata Steel, Zindal Steel also has the right to coal mining But it is like that, as much as there is area in India Suppose 90% mines are already near Coal India And I told you that they got 50 years, so they are sitting there, rest won't get So that's why Tata is saying that mine is not producing enough I want 500 kg coal, I can make 10 kg only, so I have to buy coal from Coal India Now if they go to buy coal, then Tata requires coal for its steel production And he wants to buy the coal from Coal India Now the question is, how much will Coal India sell to Tata? Will it sell 500 kg and how much will it sell to Zindal or Bhushan Steel? Will it sell 200 kg? Earlier all this was decided on the discretion of the government In other words, the company that will give more money in the Tunao fund, will get more Now the government will not do this The company that offers more money, Coal India will sell more coal So this is called Shakti Policy And this was made in 2017 Now you are saying why are you teaching so much? So I have to say that this is all given in India yearbook The professor will not go to check the current affairs of 2017 He will open the government yearbook in 2024 or 2030 So you have to prepare such things Even after doing all this, you come to know that there is a shortage of coal in India Sometimes you ask for coal from Australia, sometimes from somewhere else Why is this happening? Because I told you that most of the coal areas are owned by Coal India And they have a 50-year license monopoly Normally, the profit that Coal India is getting It should not accept all these new technologies With which mining can be done better But it gives most of its profit to the government as a dividend And the government runs it in the poverty welfare scheme Because if the government is the majority shareholder, then the government will pressure That you give us all the money So that's why they are not able to upgrade their technology That's why their production is very less So we have to order a lot of coal from outside Whether it is Australia or some other country Even Adani bought some mines in Australia But all these climate activists kept on doing it Now what did the Australian government say? We have given this mine to Adani But whenever it will export from here and go to India We will take extra tax on it So all this tax is kept on it So when that Australian coal comes to India It becomes expensive for us Electricity becomes expensive If electricity is expensive, then all the production will be expensive So this creates a lot of problem for India These are the leaders of America, Britain and Europe They talk a lot of kick me to bitty They have to say that you are all the people of India and China So you are polluting the electricity produced by burning coal You are responsible for all the pollution We are all milkmen We have never done anything We use solar energy from day 1 to the end of the month And then what will be the name of the UNFCCC and its parish deal? They will say that all this is booked by India and China And we will not give any money to it And India and China All the nuclear technology of America and Europe You will have to buy all this So the economic survey said that this is their carbon imperialism Imperialism means This is the thing of enslaving the world and all It is their imperialism Now they want to sell us their nuclear technology So that you know If you have diabetes, you can check it with a meter You can check diabetes with blood glucose level So that machine is very cheap It is of 500,000 rupees Because the real income is in the refilling or syringe Or STPI measurement kit Similarly, why do they want to sell you nuclear technology? Once you have installed this, then you have to buy fuel from it So they will earn money But this is not affordable for us This is not sustainable for us We have to burn coal The 24x7 in wind and solar does not remain You need a lot of land in solar and wind Then only you can plant it If coal mining is stopped, many people will become unemployed So we cannot do this So this is the carbon imperialism We have to fight this And secondly, solar cell, wind turbine, nuclear reactor If all this is to be made Then India needs a lot of critical minerals, precious minerals Lithium, graphite, copper, aluminum All this is needed So this is not possible for us In the budget, it is different Okay, coal has to be burned But there should be less pollution Let's do something like this So gasification of the coal That the coal should be partially oxidized And some new fuel gas should be found from it And it should be burned to produce less pollution And from this whole process You will get formally high ethylene, acetic acid, chemical And help in the rest of the chemical industry All this keeps going Anyway, you can read more about all this in science and technology If you want to do research in mining Then a portal has been made for it Whose name is Satyabhama portal And it was made during corona So for whom is Satyabhama portal? Research in mining Then there was GMPN's portal For whom was it? I remember it was for MSME So remember it There are many other portals Which we have gone ahead After this, there is no limit to the portal and scheme You remember it If you don't remember, I will leave it to you See, how many portals can be asked in a single prelim Will they ask two? He doesn't have to ask hundreds of portals So remember as much as possible So that your effort is saved Then you have to download this material and that material And PT 365 and 730 and 5012 numbers So there is no need to do all that You have to give it here, you see Okay So now we talk about energy Energy has the power ministry So its yearbook information Ministry, department, statutory body See it in your handouts After that, there will be many schemes No rocket science, it is easy See it once or twice, you will remember So we do that First you have to keep some data That the electricity produced in India So which source is the most So I have made a cartoon in your handouts What is number one? It is made of coal Number two, all this is made of wind, solar and renewable The third number, this dam means hydropower And the fourth number is nuclear So if you don't have all this nuclear technology Then there will be very little production in it Okay, so this is the ranking of electricity generation in India Remember to keep all this I did a question on telegram once Many people were hitting Kukki So this should not be a mistake All the electricity making companies in India Like Torrent Reliance So all these are private sector companies 49% State government has 26% And union has 25% So that is the break up Then the Ministry of Power Which is the statutory body and government company See it in your handouts Power Ministry has made so many app portals That even Google Play store will crash So remember it Otherwise, leave it Then your hard work is left So I have given it in the handouts So then there is no need to do this PTE 25, 26 What is new? Ministry of Power and Ministry of Renewable Energy Started an expert research In which this electric vehicle and battery And will do all this research In total, there are 6-7 sectors Remember which are specific Torrent Electricity Company This is the company Which is the most famous in the world And the company is the most famous in the world Torrent Electricity Company Which sells electricity in Ahmedabad Suppose they have produced 100 kg electricity And Reliance produces in Mumbai And they have produced 90 kg When Mumbai people say We have to run a lot of AC For 120 kg So what are they doing? We buy from Ahmedabad So if such electricity companies Have to do buying and selling Then there is an online platform Of that company Whose name is IEX This is the company Which wants to sell Its surplus electricity To any other state company And wants to buy So that is Indian Energy Exchange Limited Which helps in buying and selling Of electricity among the electricity companies So then Especially The Hindu newspaper Their company Their newspaper Theirs is not like this Their parents, siblings, husband and wife All these are not there Only one thing And that is IEX And they are sitting idle Then what will they do? There is a separate portal for electricity So they do a separate portal for selling gas And the third one is A separate portal for green energy So whatever they do They have to take their flag and do PHD I do not agree with them Maximum one question can be made I do not see a single question Because this is not a government company This is a private sector company Who is asking so many theses Of a private sector company? And then they come to The current affairs media So that is a separate thing Sometimes I feel That I should leave coaching And start a dialogue Like Kailash Satyarthi did And talk about Uttar Pradesh Suppose Kerala has surplus electricity And UP wants it So can we sell it to each other? And if there is then You have to create some Whatever electricity poles Going from Kerala to UP So when you do this What will you call it? One nation one grid To help the state governments Or any other private sector companies In different states They can do electricity buying and selling So one nation one grid Now here you will think That they will do mostly coal electricity Which is run by AC power Then the solar electricity Which is 24x7 So whatever it is Converted in DC Stored in battery So can we sell it here or not? For example Rajasthan's solar electricity Can you sell it in Delhi or not? Or Tamil Nadu's wind energy You need to create some Separate mechanism Because AC-DC can have some problem So when you set it What will you call it? Green energy corridor And this is inside India This is sold internationally And they sell green one So what will you call it? Its name is green grid Or one sun one world one grid O-S-O-W-O-G Similarly India has surplus electricity Africa has surplus And we are talking about Clean solar energy So that is One sun one world one grid initiative When did this happen? All this is given in the general knowledge handout You can see it So we were understanding electricity You will see power ministry in the handout Now there are different schemes That we understand First we have to understand That the electricity companies Always have problems And they are facing loss But why is this? There are different reasons for this During the UPA congress Electricity distribution company Like Reliance power and power What was their problem? Electricity theft What is there in that? Take the police and beat them And then they will be in front And then the ruling party Or state government Will think that our votes will go Don't do so much damage to these villagers So the losses of electricity companies Increases when the state government Does not deal with electricity theft strictly Second, in that time Due to flood, cyclone, tsunami Coal mining was affected I told you that coal came So the supreme court Cancelled many licenses So coal supply was reduced Similarly some people Went to the supreme court And put restrictions on coal mining Some laborers went on strike So due to all this Coal supply was irregular And due to that Their business losses increased And due to that They started having non-performing assets Means banks started having Non-performing assets Because these people These electricity discompanies Were unable to repay their loans on time The second problem was Who decides the price of electricity? The answer is its law Electricity Act 2003 Which has two different statutory bodies One is the state Electricity regulatory commission Means different for UP Different for Bihar, Kerala, Jharkhand Every state has its own State electricity regulatory commission It will decide What should be the state And what should be the state of the unit Agriculture, commercial, residential And commercial, residential area This is one thing The second is Central electricity regulatory commission CERC Its work is to Decide the interstate sale of electricity"
