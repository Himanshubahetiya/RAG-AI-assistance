I am teaching polity course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":" Intro, Mining, Energy].mp4","number":"3 ","start":841.0,"end":851.0,"text":" This is a spy  thriller movie.  So, this is  CPI, this is WPI.  So, that is there.  But what  have you calculated  overall?  So, we are  calculating headline"},{"title":" cause, effect, types, measurement].mp4 (2)","number":"1 ","start":110.48,"end":121.1,"text":" Anyway so that was the quiz  Now our next part is inflation  I have uploaded the handout  If you are watching from desktop or laptop  You can go to PCP 11 course  Click on update button  Right side sidebar opens  You can download from there  Although there is some problem  Some technical bugs"},{"title":" Intro, Mining, Energy].mp4","number":"3 ","start":456.0,"end":470.0,"text":" Here, the base year is different.  Remember.  CPI is 2012.  WPA is 2011.  People who calculate these are different.  CPI is calculated by NSO which is under the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation.  WPA is done by a different officer.  He is the economic advisor to DPIIT.  DPIIT is the department under the Commerce Ministry.  We have seen what it was in pillar 3."}]

"where is the cpi in this course"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
